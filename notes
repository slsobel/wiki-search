    # Due to the route decorator, prompt function, and wiki-search module, could not get home.html into script without overriding the prompt's return statement.
    # Thus, the page has no layout or styling :(

    # Played around with trying to prompt user for input via a form on the landing page.

@app.route('/', methods = ["GET", "POST"])
def search():
    if request.method == "POST":
        search_term = request.form.get("searchTerm")
        return render_template("form.html")

# @app.route('/', subdomain = input(__))

# gets search term from user input from home search bar
# uses python input() method 
        # search_word = input('Search here!') --> or is there a different way to take the form input and insert it into the input()?
    # validates form input/data using WTForms (works with Flask)
    # assigns variable name to input as wildcard string literal?
    # takes user input (variable) and adds to next function/step
# inserts variable in app.route to make call (GET) using that endpoint (use CLI cURL to test)
